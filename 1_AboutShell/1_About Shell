What is Shell?

A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input.

=> Shell scripts are interpreted not compiled.

Commands:
Show all shells:
-> cat /etc/shells
Location of bash
-> which bash

bash => born again shell
-> standard GNU shell
-> improved version of sh

Files created with touch commands have read and write permissions and not execute permissions. Permission modification:

chmod +x hello.sh => Provides execute permission as well to the file.
